# Generative AI Code Samples
-----------------------------

Welcome to the Generative AI Code Samples repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python applications that serve as code samples and notes for learning generative AI topics and technologies. These resources are curated from official documentations and courses, covering areas such as LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and more.

## Contents

The repository contains a variety of code samples and notes organized into Jupyter notebooks and Python applications. Each notebook includes markdown cells explaining the purpose of each code cell and providing context for the projects.

## Usage

1. **Exploring Notebooks:**
   - Navigate through the notebooks to explore different generative AI topics and technologies.
   - Review the markdown cells for explanations and context about each code sample and project.

2. **Running Python Applications:**
   - Execute Python applications to see code samples in action.
   - Refer to the README files within each application folder for specific instructions.

## Contributing

If you find any errors, have suggestions for improvement, or want to contribute your own code samples, feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions from the community are highly appreciated and help improve the learning experience for everyone.


## Environment Variables
